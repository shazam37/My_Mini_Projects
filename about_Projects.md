1. ISS-Overhead tracker

-> I have written a code which can alert you via email whether the International Space Station can be observed from your location between the sunrise and sunset time. There are two separate functions. One send the API request to iss-now.json website. The other sends API request to sunrise-sunset.org. Based on the information we obtain, we proceed to send the mail. 

2. Auto Birthday-Wisher

-> I have written a code that if uploaded on the cloud can run continously and send birthday wishes email to my contacts. We store the birthdate information of our contacts in a csv file. We itertate over the csv file all the time to check whether anyone's birthdate falls today so that the program can send email. There are several templates for the birthday wish which is randomly chosen by the program.
