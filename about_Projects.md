1. ISS-Overhead tracker

-> I have written a code which can alert you via email whether the International Space Station can be observed from your location between the sunrise and sunset. There are two separate functions. One send the API request to iss-now.json website. The other sends API request to sunrise-sunset.org. Based on the information we obtain, we proceed to send the mail. 

2. Auto Birthday-Wisher

-> I have written a code that if uploaded on the cloud can run continously and send birthday wishes email to my contacts. We store the birthdate information as csv file. We keep checking with iteration whether the birthday is on that day.
